# Eat Da Burger App


### App General Functionality

Eat Da Burger was designed to allow a user to type in the name of a burger that they would like to eat, into the textbox in the center of the page. Then upon the click of the submit button, the burger becomes an item that is able to be "Devoured." This process is achieved by the burger name being stored into a MySQL database, for data persistance, where it waits for the user to "Devour It." Once a user chooses to "Devour" a burger that is available for consumption, the BOOLEAN variable, which was initialized originally to false by default, becomes true, and the burger is "Devoured", and longer available for consumption.


### App Technical Functionality

This App was created, to demonstrate the mastery of working with handlebarsJS, and MySQL, for data persistance. It also serves as a project demonstrating the proper structure of an application directory, that contins multiple files and files types, as well as implementing use of an ORM and connection file in the config folder.
